    <p>Website <span>functionality</span> is essentially what your website can do and how it works. It encompasses everything from the actions a user can perform to dynamic content and interactivity.</p>

Before your website is ever written, designed, or coded, you should have a clear scope of the features it will offer. Getting halfway through a website build just to realize that you are missing some essential <span>functionality</span> can quickly derail a project!</p>

<p>So where do you begin narrowing down the requirements for your website? Use this article to guide you through the process of defining your websiteâ€™s <span>functionality</span> needs.</p>
