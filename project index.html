  <h2>Website`s definition</h2>
<div class="a">
 <p>A <span>website</span>  (also written as web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Notable examples are wikipedia.org, google.com, and amazon.com.

All publicly accessible <span>websites</span>  collectively constitute the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>There are also private <span>websites</span>  that can only be accessed on a private network, such as a company's internal <span>website</span>  for its employees.

<span>websites</span>  are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or social networking.</p><p> Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page.

Users can access <span>websites</span>  on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The software application used on these devices is called a web browser.
